            <p>Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text 
            to complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.</p>
            <p>web developing tools involves programming lanuages like HTML,JAVASCRIPT,CSS.</p>

                <h5>HTML</h5>
                <p>Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</p>
                <p>It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
                <p>It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.</p>
                <p>Overall, HTML is a markup language that is really straightforward and easy to learn even for complete beginners in website building. </p>
                <p>Hypertext means a text that contains references (links) to other texts that viewers can access immediately. First version of HTML published in 1991,</p>
                <p>consisting of 18 HTML tags. Since then, each new version of the HTML language came with new tags and attributes (tag modifiers) to the markup.</p>
                <p>HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. You can view then using any web browser (such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox).</p>
                <p>The browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.</p>

        <div class="css">
            <h5>CSS</h5>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup language.</p>
            <p>It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.</p>
            <p>CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text,</p>
            <p>the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, </p>
            <p>layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.</p>
            <p>CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly,</p>
            <p>CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.</p>

            <h5>JavaScript</h5>
            <p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages,</p>
            <p>whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages.</p>
            <p>It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages,</p>
            <p>every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at displaying timely content updates,</p>
            <p>interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. â€” you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.</p>
            <p>It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail.</p>
